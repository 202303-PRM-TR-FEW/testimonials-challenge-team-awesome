        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
        every penny’s worth.

      “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
      looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
      amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
      it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
      the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
      course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
      Engineer at a VR startup. ”
